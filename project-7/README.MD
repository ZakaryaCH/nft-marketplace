1. Escrow system

a. My NFTs page customization:

User sees four groups of NFTs:

i. Listed NFTs

ii. Non lised NFTs

iii. Ongoing transactions, for the transaction to be confirmed, both parties should confirm:

 - Bought and pending confirmations
 - Sold and pending confirmations

 Every NFT in this category should have a "confirm transaction button"

 iv. Confirmed and pending admin release, here the transaction is validated by both parties and waiting for the admin to forward the funds and the NFT

 b. Admin page:
 listing of:
 All ongoing operations with number of confirmations (1 or 2) with option to:
 1. validate confirmed operations and trigger the NFT and funds forwarding
 2. Cancel operation

 All confirmed operations


2. Chat system
it should allow users to exchange messages in the NFT marketplace, no specific requirements, let's find the easiest way to do it
